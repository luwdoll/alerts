# Jcink Scripts
Various scripts and templates created specifically for Jcink / JFS. The Jcink mods are typically Javascript plugins used to enhance the features provided by Jcink. I also try to make these compatible with other third-party modifications, especially [CFS](https://github.com/ConnorWiseman/jcink-custom-structure). 

I'm also (very) open to code reviews and improvements. Javascript is my preferred language.
